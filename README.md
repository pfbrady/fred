# Fred

Fred is a multi-purpose Discord Bot written in Python, for use on various YMCA of Delaware Aquatics Discord Servers.
It relies primarily on the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) library and sucessfully integrates
the YMCA of Delaware's scheduling solution (WhenToWork) and document submission solution (Formstack) into it's
commands and tasks.

It is not intended for personal use; however, the source code is provided here as is.
